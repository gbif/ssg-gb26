## Travel requirements for entering the Netherlands

GB26 participants are responsible for preparing their own travel documentation requirements for entering Ireland.

### Visa

## Local transportation in Leiden

Dutch public transport requires a so-called OV-chipkaart, a smart card that can be used for bus, tram, train and metro services. Since there is no specific OV-chipkaart for visitor, we recommend using either a single-use chipcard or an ‘anonymous OV-chipkaart’. The single-use chipcard has limited validity and can be used to travel on bus/tram/metro lines in a single city. If you want to travel by train, you can buy a different single-use chipcard that is valid on the train for your specified itinerary only. If you are staying in Holland for more than a few days and plan to travel by public transport more frequently, we recommend the anonymous OV-chipkaart as the best and most economic ticket for your trips since it can be used for all public means of transport in Holland. More information about getting an [ov chip kaart](https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/plan-your-holiday/getting-around-in-holland/public-transport/ov-chip-card-5.htm).

## Tourist information - Leiden, City of Discoveries

Leiden has been one of Europe's most prominent scientific centres for more than four centuries. Leiden University is the oldest university of the Netherlands, home to thirteen Nobel Prize winners. Many important scientific discoveries have been made here, giving rise to Leiden's motto: ‘City of Discoveries’. 

Leiden is also one of the oldest cities in The Netherlands with 800 years of visible history. It is famous for its old city centre with its canals, city gates, bridges, windmills, a castle, an observatory, the botanical gardens, weavers’ homes, almshouses, two large late gothic churches and several historical edifices.

Stroll along the canals and on the narrow streets of the old city centre. Tread in the footsteps of Rembrandt or discover the pillars of medical history of the Netherlands in the Hortus botanicus, the Academy building, the workplaces of Professor Boerhaave and an anatomic theatre from the 16th century.
